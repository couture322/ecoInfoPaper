<div>The open science movement has developed new technologies and
worked to move science forward with a culture of data sharing but, as this
study shows, there is still a lot of work to be done. We found that while the
reasons for <i>not</i> sharing were uniform
across groups, a scientistâ€™s field of research was the strongest indicator of
whether they would collaborate to archive required datasets in a public
repository. To address this obstacle, emerging tools should begin to target barriers
specific to these fields with proportionately lower representation. Some of
these barriers might include protecting proprietary information, difficulty in
describing methods or post-processing, and difficulty preparing data. Funders
and publishers should provide more support and more stringent requirements for
data sharing. Incorporating data support and tools into the funding or
publication process will help to progress data sharing. Finally, personal
incentives such as DOI citation for datasets should be more widely used to
increase the impact of a particular dataset as well as recognition for data
use. Although the integration of data publication into the scientific process
has been slow to adopt, it is important to increasing efficiency and
transparency in science. The open science community should continue to impress
upon the collective benefits of open science and develop the reward system for
data sharing. <br></div>
