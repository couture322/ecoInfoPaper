Status was classified using the  project status labels we used during the efforts to track each step of the process [??? should I describe these here or will SC describe them above?] Field of study was determined based on title and abstract information (when available). Data are categorized into broad fields: physical, biological, oil, modeling. Since the majority of projects focus on biology, we divided these up further to look at different fields of biology as well. The main agency sector was based on them home institution of the project's primary investigator and grouped into projects lead by federal governmental, state/local governmental, academic, private - non-profit, private - for profit and tribal parties. Although projects were funded a year at a time, projects lasting multiple years were counted as the same project. EVOSTC grants require data to be published one year after collection but to avoid double counting, we based temporal analyses on the last year an entire time series of a project was funded.<br></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div>Email sent: find contact information and reach out for the data from a specific EVOSTC project<br></div></li><ul><li><div>email (multiples)<br></div></li><ul><li><div>PI and other associated parties<br></div></li></ul><li><div>call<br></div></li><li><div>find other sources of these data within agency<br></div></li></ul><li><div>replied: we have the correct contact information and data request has been received<br></div></li><ul><li><div>potentially discussed data request and work it would take to obtain it<br></div></li><li><div>potentially multiple contacts (eg: talk to this person about getting those data…)<br></div></li></ul><li><div>sentData: data were received from the owner/contact<br></div></li><ul><li><div>contact has sent the data and/or metadata<br></div></li><li><div>may need to continue to work with the scientist of contact to prepare the data/metadata for publication<br></div></li></ul><li><div>dataRevised: data have been successfully formatted and metadata created<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Data can be stalled here if the researcher was cooperative in providing data and assisting with formatting but requested for the data to not be published until a later date<br></div></li><li><div>Alternatively temporary revised status exists before the PI is able to review the completed package and accept for publication<br></div></li></ul><li><div>published: data &amp;/or metadata have been published to the <a href="http://goa.nceas.ucsb.edu">GOA data portal</a><br></div></li><li><div>Unrecoverable: various reasons data were determined lost or otherwise unavailable<br></div></li></ul><div><br></div><div>Statistical Analysis: <br></div><div><br></div><div>For each of these four classifications, differences between groups were assessed using simple binomial statistics tests: Chi-squared and binomial linear regression (BLM). If the chi-squared test showed differences between groups, a BLM was run to identify which groups resulted in the biggest positive or negative result. <br></div><div><br></div>
