<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion<br></h1><div>Overall we documented a low rate of data recovery, with
data successfully recovered from 26% of all funded projects. This rate is
similar to previously published data recovery efforts (see Wollins 1962 who
reported a 24% success rate, Wichert et al. 2006 who reported 26%, Savage &amp;
Vickers 2009 who reported 10%), even though we invested considerably more
effort in data recovery in terms of person hours, number of projects for which
we requested data, number of contact attempts, and provision of 1:1 data support
relative to these 3 studies. Although many projects comprised multiple
datasets, we considered success to be the receipt of any (but not necessary
all) data associated with a funded project. Therefore, our estimate is
conservative and likely masks a much lower recovery rate at the dataset level.
In contrast to our expectations, we did not observe a greater recovery rate
among more recent projects, although we did observe a statistically
insignificant increase in the fraction of projects for which data recovery was
successful in the most recent year studied. Recovery rate did not vary with
agency type, but did vary with research field.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>We document a data recovery rate similar to that reported
by Wollins over 50 years ago [Wollins 1962], despite several important advances
in the intervening time period that should have promoted and facilitated data
sharing. We highlight three such advances here. First, implementation of data
sharing requirements by funding agencies and publishers (noting that this was a
requirement for all projects funded by the EVOSTC) had no apparent effect on
our recovery rate relative to that of Wollins, nor those of Wichert et al.
(2006) or Savage &amp; Vickers (2009), both of which requested data associated
with publications whose journals required data sharing on request, an arguably
less restrict stipulation. Second, the advent of a culture of open science and
data sharing should promote data publication particularly with newer data. The
expectation would not be that such a movement would revive older data, but
rather that new data would receive wider distribution, thus favoring a trend
towards more recently produced data [Molloy 2011].&nbsp;Our analysis of reasons
data were not shared, discussed below, demonstrates that this open science culture
did not influence this particular population. Perhaps the open science movement
was too immature when the archiving effort was conducted to make a measurable
impact. Third, our recovery rate appeared unaffected by technological advances
in data capture, storage (including large volume storage), accessibility, and
ease of duplication and transfer (including electronic data formats and email
availability). Rather, we observed that: 1)&nbsp;only a small proportion of
data we received was non-digital (4% of projects, n = 10); 2) only a small
percentage of non-recoverable data fell into the 'other' category (which
included obsolete technology; 7% of projects, n = 17); and 3) we saw no
difference in recovery rate between projects in the first half (1989 – 2000) versus
second half (2000 – 2010) of the funding period or between projects conducted
greater than 5 years prior to our data request. These findings indicate that
advances in technology have not played an important factor in our results,
perhaps due to limited awareness, access or adoption of new tools.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>In spite of these advances in data sharing, non-recovery
of data was most commonly attributable to: 1) loss of contact with data holders
(50% of non-recovered projects, n = 116); 2) lack of contact information (35%
of non-recovered projects, n = 82);&nbsp;and 3) loss of data by the data holder
(7% of non-recovered projects, n=17). Since these results were uniform across
time, research field and sector, the low recovery rate we experienced points to
a general a lack of foresight for long-term data archiving on the part of data
PIs and funding agencies as the most important barrier to data sharing. This
lack of foresight encompasses a lack of planning to handle attrition of
personnel (e.g. movement of personnel between institutions, retirement, death)
and may also reflect an absence of adequate data curation procedures, rendering
it difficult and time consuming to reconstruct datasets suitable for use by
others unfamiliar with the original work (Wichert et al. 2006, Savage &amp;
Vickers 2009). The latter is supported by the fact that several data PIs (1% of
projects, n = 3)<i>&nbsp;</i>requested funding for the time they would need to
format data for sharing, despite having agreed to share data upon acceptance of
the original funding. The issue is exacerbated by a frequent lack of
institutional support within government agencies that may lack dedicated funds,
and by extension personnel, for processing&nbsp;data sharing requests.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant
differences in data recovery rates between research sectors. In fact, the data
suggest a trend in the opposite direction but we were unable to detect
statistical significance, likely due to large differences in the number of
projects funded within each sector type (n=3-120; SuppFigure 1). That the most
public groups had the lowest rates of data sharing suggests a resource limitation
among these groups. Personal correspondences with these groups confirm this
conclusion. &nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>We did find, however, statistically significant variation
in data recovery between research fields, concluding that the research fields
of oil, physical oceanography, plankton, and benthic invertebrates were more
likely to share their data than the fields of fisheries, birds, mammals,
habitat, modeling, and social studies. We expand on potential reasons for this
below. In general, differences in recovery rates by research field may be
attributable, in part, to the time required to prepare data for sharing as well
as whether or not certain data types are considered difficult to interpret
leading to a mistrust in its use.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>There are a number of reasons specific to the topics
of&nbsp;oil, physical oceanography, plankton, and invertebrates which may
explain why researchers in these fields are likely to share their data. Almost
all of the oil data sets sought during this data salvaging project were
collected by a single agency (NOAA's Auke Bay laboratory), so it was
straightforward to obtain many data sets once communication with that agency
was opened. Furthermore, these data were likely managed more carefully from the
beginning due to the legal relevance of oil records following the spill.&nbsp; Meanwhile, both physical oceanography and
plankton data sets are often collected using systematic and automated
approaches. Once data are collected, they often do not require manual data
entry or post-processing but are already in a final format that is ready to be
shared. Previous research indicates data sharing increases with the level of
data collection automation&nbsp;[Pritchard et al. 2004]. We postulate that
researchers may also be likely to share benthic invertebrate data because these
are collected using direct observation, using established methods. Again, here
the data are ready to share immediately without post-processing or fear of
misinterpretation.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>There are several reasons why researchers in fields
relating to fisheries, birds, mammals, and social studies may not share their
data.&nbsp;While data sharing and data recovery between scientists,
stakeholders, and institutions is a challenge for many fields, the field of
fisheries poses unique challenges that may also require unique solutions to
overcome. Fisheries data are often sensitive in nature. They may be used for
assessing vulnerable stocks that are fished by diverse groups, setting
management controls such as total allowable catch limits, or monitoring the
catch of sensitive or protected species. This can understandably raise concern
with stakeholders who may worry that sharing their data could reveal prized
fishing grounds, result in more restrictive or inequitable management, reveal
illegal fishing patterns, or even lead to a fishery or particular areas being
closed [Froese et al 2004; Mackinson et al 2011]. To overcome these concerns, a
shared culture and strategy of collaborative research and data management
should be developed between scientists, fishers, decision-makers, and other
stakeholders from the onset of any new fisheries data collection program.
Through this approach, shared expectations and objectives can be set such that
all stakeholders understand how data will be used and how this may impact
management decisions [CEC 2009; Johnson et al. 2007; Wiber et al. 2009].<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Meanwhile, the sharing of bird and mammal data faces its
own unique challenges due to variations in methods and data complexities. These
highly mobile species with potentially large home ranges require careful post
analysis to extrapolate population sizes. Researchers may therefore be hesitant
to share these data with a broader audience over fears of misinterpretation or
misuse.&nbsp;<i> </i>Bird data often includes estimates of population
abundance. However, estimating population abundance could be obtained from
direct or indirect observation, each of which come with certain assumptions and
sampling techniques, making their integration into larger analyses non-trivial
[Baker and Millerand 2010]. Specifically, seabird data is often complex with
estimates dependent on sitings, nesting success, or colony size. However, with
no recognized standard for how these data should be structured researchers may
be reluctant to share with scientists unfamiliar with internal protocols [Huettmann
2011]. Meanwhile, researchers studying marine mammals often work with small
populations with limited geographic coverage, such as dolphins that may not
travel widely. These researchers may be protective over their research
population due to a developed intimacy with their subjects and may fear that
disclosing their locations could increase their poaching risk [Meyer 2009].
Alternatively, for populations with global ranges, determining population size
from discrete observation takes deeper knowledge of the organism and specific
population, again, perpetuating a fear that data might be misinterpreted but
external users. To add to the complications in these data, marine mammal photo
ID projects, for example, do not follow a common naming, format, or filing standard
[Baker and Millerand 2010].<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Finally, recovery of social science data also shares many
of the same challenges as those faced with other data types, but comes with its
own unique for limitation. In particular, there may be concerns that social
science data sets involving individual human subjects could risk the of privacy
and confidentiality of their subjects if data are mishandled. These concerns
could be mitigated, however, by protection of human subject anonymity through
the deletion of identifiers,&nbsp;aggregation of data away from individuals,
and privacy-enhanced data sharing protocols and intellectual property rules
[Fienberg et al. 1985, Sieber 1991, King 2011]. These steps would, though, require
additional post-processing, inhibiting effortless sharing.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Inherent in all of the above reasons we report for
non-recovery of data is the absence of a reward structure for sharing data.
There is no reward for the time investment required to learn how to curate data
or reconstruct data packages where data curation was insufficient. The
application of digital object identifiers (DOIs) to datasets allows data to be
cited in the same way we site publications. Although this is a relatively new
practice, as DOIs become more widely used, we can begin to incorporate data
citations into a scientists’ overall impact score along with publication
citations. Furthermore, once funding is delivered and papers are published,
funding agencies and journals have little power to enforce data sharing
requirements. These groups should enforce these requirements more stringently
and provide data tools and assistance to its users. For example, the National
Science Foundation has created a dedicated data repository, the <a href="arcticdata.io">NSF Arctic Data Center</a> (ACD), where all Arctic data projects funded by NSF can
be permanently archived, ensuring proper fulfillment the data management
requirements for their grants. In addition to the infrastructure, the NSF ADC
also employs a data support team to assist in data documentation and
attribution helping to minimize the work this requirement may add. NSF enforces
these requirements but checking for archiving with the ADC, or acceptable
substitutes, before any additional NSF funding will be granted.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>One of our main hypotheses was that data from older
projects would be less accessible [see also Michener 1997], however we found
limited evidence to support this. We did not observe a gradual decrease in data
recovery over time as expected. We did, however, observe the greatest success
rate in the most recent year, in general agreement with Michener's finding that
data recovery rates decrease with time since data collection [Michener 1997].
The expected gradual decline may have been obscured by two artifacts of our
methods: 1) Here data recovery rates were based on projects instead of
datasets, which may have masked success over time. 2) Since we calculated the
“age” of data based on only the last year of the project, few projects happened
to end in the most recent years sought, especially since EVOSTC funded projects
began to tend towards longer monitoring and synthesis work in later years (SuppFigure
2).&nbsp;Furthermore, the lack of temporal trend in information-dependent reasons
for not sharing (ie. Data loss, availability of contact information,
non-digital data) lead us to conclude that the Michener temporal trend in data
information was not supported in this study.<br></div><div><br></div>
