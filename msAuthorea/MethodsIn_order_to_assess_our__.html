<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><div>In order to assess our success, we
asked: for how many EVOSTC funded projects can we recover data? Of these
projects we were interested in trends in reporting. Particularly, we asked
which grantees were more likely to provide data and if there was a temporal
trend as predicted by Michener (1997). To test this we asked if there are
differences in data reporting based on any of three project characteristics: 1)
data field, 2) grantee's agency sector, and 3) age of data. Of the data we are
unable to recover, we wanted to know why were data not shared. Since each
funded project had an unknown number of “datasets”, we base success on the
publication of at least one dataset for any given project, regardless of size
or complexity. Throughout our extensive data recovery effort, we took careful
notes of our outreach efforts, communications and progress in publicly
archiving acquired data for use in statistical analyses.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Data recovery and archiving</b><br></div><div>From 2012 to 2014, a team of one
full-time and three part-time staff members was assigned to collect and archive
data funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC) targeting
specifically those projects funded between 1989 and 2010. Project information
was obtained from the projects page on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/index.cfm?FA=projects.search">EVOSTC website</a>,&nbsp;which includes varying levels of
detail for each project, ranging from project title only to full bibliographic
information and attached reports. We tracked the progress of the data request
and acquisition process for each project based on six stages: “emailed”,
“replied”, “sent data”, “published”, “unrecoverable”. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Contact information was obtained
through agency sites and Google searches based on the information we were able
to gather from the EVOSTC site. If we were able to find contact information for
the listed principal investigator, an initial outreach email or phone call was
made explaining the data recovery project, citing the data requirements, and
requesting data for the project in question. Projects for which outreach could
be made were labeled “emailed” and were followed up numerous times if no reply
was received. A reply to the outreach and would confirm that the contact
information was correct, the project label would be promoted to “replied”,
regardless of level of cooperation expressed in the response. If the responder determined
the data was unrecoverable, they were labeled as such and the reasons were
recorded in our tracking system.<br></div><div>Once we received data from for a
project, the label was changed to “data sent”. If the data were clean and well
documented enough and/or the contact was responsive enough to guide us through
any necessary data edits and metadata creation the data were published to
the&nbsp;<a href="https://goa.nceas.ucsb.edu/">Gulf of Alaska Historic Data Portal</a>&nbsp;and the project was labeled,
“published”.&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Statistical Analysis</b><br></div><div>At the close of the data collation
effort, we quantified the number of projects that fell into each of the above
status labels and plotted them in a simple bar chart in order to assess the
final status of our archiving undertaking. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Results of the outreach efforts
are further characterized based on three project descriptors: <i>research field
of the project</i> (field), <i>agency sector of the home institution of the
principal investigato</i>r (sector), <i>age of data when data when recovery
efforts were initiated</i> (age). Within each of these categories a binary
response (obtained or not) was used in which status classifications were
grouped as such: successful = “published”, “data sent”; unsuccessful =
“unrecoverable”, “emailed”, “replied”. Age of data is calculated as the number
of years since the last year a project received EVOSTC funding since some
projects spanned multiple years. This effort was initiated in 2012 so the most
recent data were two years old.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>The impacts of these
characteristics on the likelihood of providing data are assessed using discrete
statistical tests: Chi-squared and random forest analyses. Chi-squared tests
were run on each group of characteristics individually to test for differences
in success based on these classifications. We then asked which of these
characteristics were the most important in determining if the data from a
project will successfully be recovered. To assess the relative importance of
the three characteristics we ran a random forest analysis using the “party”
package in R. We also produced a classification tree to visualize how these
characteristics affect our outcome. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Hurdles to recovery</b><br></div><div>Also of interest were the reasons
data were not recovered. To quantify these responses we categorized the
projects for which we were unable to gather any data based on notes from our
correspondences.&nbsp; The projects included
in this analysis are those labeled from the unsuccessful grouping: “emailed”,
“replied” and “unrecoverable”. Since projects in the category “replied” where
instances where we received at least an initial reply confirming that we had
accurate contact information but lost communication before the data was sent, these
projects were re-categorized as <i>communication
lost</i>. Of the “unrecoverable” projects, notes were used to divide these
into: <i>no contact information</i>, <i>data lost</i>, <i>non-digital data</i>, <i>unwilling
to share</i>, and <i>requested additional
funding</i>. The projects from the “emailed” status have been added to the <i>no contact information</i> group since we
were never able to confirm the outreach efforts actually reached the target
recipient. Data are only labeled <i>data
lost</i> if our contact confirmed that they were so. Similarly, the <i>non-digital data</i>, <i>unwilling to share</i> and <i>requested
additional funding</i> cases are only labeled as such for projects were data
requests were rejected for these confirmed reasons. Non-digital data is deemed
“unrecoverable” here since our project lacked the resources to convert or store
such data. Where possible, we have since digitized these data and published in
the archive.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
