<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><div><b>Data recovery and archiving</b><br></div><div>From 2012
to 2014, a team of one full-time and three part-time staff members was assigned
to collect and archive data funded by the EVOSTC targeting specifically those
projects funded between 1989 and 2010. Project information was obtained from
the projects page on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/index.cfm?FA=projects.search">EVOSTC website</a>,&nbsp;which includes varying levels of detail
for each project, ranging from only the project title to full bibliographic
information and attached reports. Throughout our extensive data recovery
effort, we took careful notes of our outreach efforts, communications and
progress in publicly archiving acquired data.&nbsp;
We tracked the progress of the data request and acquisition process for
each project based on six stages of increasing progress: “outreach attempted”,
“contact established”, “data received”, “published”, “unrecoverable”. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Grantee
contact information was obtained through agency websites and Google searches
based on the information we were able to gather from the EVOSTC website. If we
were able to find contact information for the listed grantee, an initial outreach
email or phone call was made and efforts and communications were tracked on an
internal ticketing system. The data support team conducted data outreach and
provided data support in the form of data formatting and metadata creation in
order to minimize barriers to data sharing. Recovered data were published to
the&nbsp;<a href="https://goa.nceas.ucsb.edu/">Gulf of
Alaska Historic Data Portal</a>. At the close of the data recovery effort (fall
2014), we quantified the number of projects that fell into each of the six
status labels to assess the final status of the data recovery effort. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Trends in data recovery</b><br></div><div>Projects were
further characterized based on three project descriptors: <i>research field of
the project</i> (field), <i>agency sector of the home institution of the
grantee</i> (sector), <i>age of data when data when recovery efforts were
initiated</i> (age). Within each of these categories a binary response (recovered
or not recovered) was used, and status classifications were grouped as follows:
recovered = “published”, “data received”; not recovered = “unrecoverable”,
“outreach attempted”, “contact established”. Age of data was calculated as the
number of years since the last year a project received EVOSTC funding since many
projects spanned multiple years. This effort was initiated in 2012 so the most
recent data pursued were two years old.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>The impacts of these
characteristics on the likelihood of providing data were assessed using
discrete statistical tests: Chi-squared and random forest analyses. Chi-squared
tests were run on each group of characteristics individually to test for
differences in success based on these classifications. We then asked which of these
characteristics were the most important in determining if the data from a
project was successfully be recovered. To assess the relative importance of the
three characteristics we conducted a random forest analysis in R version 3.3.3
using the “party” package and produced a classification tree to visualize how
these characteristics affect our outcome (Hothorn et al, 2006a, Hothorn et al. 2006b, Strobl et al. 2007, Strobl et al. 2008).&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Hurdles to recovery</b><br></div><div>Also of
interest were the reasons data were not recovered. To quantify these responses
we categorized the projects for which we were unable to gather any data based
on notes from our correspondence.&nbsp; The
projects included in this analysis were those labeled from the not recovered
grouping. &nbsp;Reasons were only recorded
when we had direct confirmation through communications, otherwise projects that
were not recovered were characterized based on their status (eg. The projects
from the “outreach attempted” status have been added to the <i>no contact information</i> group since we
were never able to confirm the outreach efforts actually reached the target
recipient.) Non-digital data is deemed “unrecoverable” here since our project
lacked the resources to convert or store such data. Where possible, we have
since digitized these data and published in the archive.<br></div><div><br></div>
