<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction<br></h1><div>In order to enhance discovery, efficiency and transparency in their work, scientists have begun developing a revolutionary approach to their disciplines known broadly as open science. This fledgling movement prioritizes the comprehensive, public sharing of scientific work, from initial brainstorming through final publication. As the theory of open science gains popularity within scientific institutions around the globe, many researchers are discovering a variety of difficulties in the application of this exciting new trend (citation). &nbsp; Though, in this quest for full disclosure, scientists have developed a number of tools to facilitate openness at each step of the scientific process, those deeply involved in this development acknowledge that the movement is still in its adolescence (citation).&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Indispensable as a foundation of scientific inquiry, accessibility to data is an essential element within a more transparent science that faces both conceptual and practical obstacles. An historic culture of perceived ownership over one’s data, combined with an environment of competition for funding and access to publication space serves as a cultural impediment to the adoption of data sharing practices (citation).&nbsp; Efforts to defend their ideas from theft, and secure publication opportunities often involve withholding data from the larger scientific community<i>.&nbsp;</i> Additionally, many of our commonly used data tools neglect to prepare data for publication or sharing and therefore require additional training, effort and resources to complete this extra step. While tools have been developed to help scientists responsibly archive their data in a manner that will be accessible and preserved through time these tools and an understanding of their appropriate use are still sparsely available to scientists. William Michener hypothesizes a temporal degradation in the knowledge of one’s own data, and concludes that the older data are, the less information exists of both the data itself and associated metadata (Michener 1997). Given this conclusion it is realistic to assume that older data will inherently be less accessible than newer data even to those most in intimately associated with it. Furthermore, accelerating changes in technology should further support an increase in barriers over time, as archiving and file formats become obsoleted.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>A number of studies have tested the availability of data under open publication requirements, some dating back to the 1960s. These studies have focused on relatively small sample sizes and data acquisition efforts and have consistently recovered <i>a mere</i> 20-30% of the data requested (Wolins 1962, Wicherts et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009, Alsheikh-Ali et al. 2011). We wanted to test whether a larger and more contemporary (make this more specific) effort would return a higher percentage of data than previous studies, and also provide documentation reflecting why data were not acquired.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>To accomplish this analysis, we decided to focus our study on the data-collection efforts of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC).&nbsp; In 2010 the EVOSTC funded the Gulf Watch Alaska group to create an open archive of the data collected under their grants. The EVOSTC was formed following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Gulf of Alaska in 1989, and has funded hundreds of projects since its inception.&nbsp; As a result the data we were seeking would span more than two decades. The EVOSTC required the publication of data within one year of data collection for all recipients of their grants, but did not specify or provide a publication platform. Grants provided by the group funded government agencies, private consulting firms and non-governmental organizations, as well as Alaskan native groups. The diversity of the grantees was also compounded by the variety of scientific disciplines under which they operated.&nbsp; Within such a broad field of data-collection, we wanted to know for how many of these projects we could acquire data, if there were trends in data reporting based on data or grantee characteristics and, if data were not procured, why we were unsuccessful. The EVOSTC did make an effort to collect these data in the mid 1990s but the success of this effort is unknown as the content of this collection has since been lost.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>
