<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction<br></h1><div>In order to enhance discovery,
efficiency and transparency in their work, scientists have begun developing a <b>revolutionary</b> approach to their
disciplines known broadly as open science. This fledgling movement prioritizes
the comprehensive, public sharing of scientific work, from initial
brainstorming through final publication. As the theory of open science gains
popularity within scientific institutions around the globe, many researchers
are discovering difficulties in the application of this exciting new trend
(citation). Though, in this quest for full disclosure, a number of tools have
been designed to facilitate openness at each step of the scientific process,
those deeply involved in this development acknowledge that the movement is
still in its adolescence (citation).&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Indispensable as a foundation of
scientific inquiry, accessibility to data is an essential element within a more
transparent science that faces both conceptual and practical obstacles. An
historic culture of perceived ownership over one’s data, combined with an
environment of competition for funding and access to publication space serves
as a cultural impediment to the adoption of data sharing practices
(citation).&nbsp; Efforts to defend their ideas from theft, and secure
publication opportunities often involve withholding data from the larger
scientific community<i>.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Many of our commonly used data tools
neglect to prepare data for publication or sharing and therefore require
additional training, effort and resources to complete this extra step. While
tools have been developed to help scientists responsibly archive their data in
a manner that will be accessible and preserved through time these tools and an
understanding of their appropriate use are still sparsely available to
scientists. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>As tools become more available to
facilitate data documentation and sharing one would expect an increase in data
availability over time. Larger and faster servers, more accessible tools such
as Github, the cloud and free online repositories, which have been popularized
in the past decade, should lead to more sharing than previous decades. On a
more personal level, William Michener hypothesizes a temporal degradation in
the knowledge of one’s own data. He concludes that the older data are the less
information exists about the data and associated metadata both within the
collector’s memory and the physical form of the data (1997). Given this
conclusion it is realistic to assume that older data will inherently be less
accessible than newer data even to those most in intimately associated with it.
Furthermore, increasing support for the open science movement would suggest an
improved willingness to share data and underscore the hypothesis that more data
should be available in recent years than in earlier history. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>A number of studies have tested
the availability of data under open publication requirements. These studies
have focused on relatively small sample sizes (n=37, 141, 10, 50; respectively)
and outreach efforts and have consistently recovered&nbsp;less than 30% of the data requested
(Wolins 1962, Wicherts et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009, Alsheikh-Ali et
al. 2011). Would a larger and more current effort return a higher percentage of
data than previous studies?<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>In addition to variation over
time, one might also assume there would be differences in data sharing between
research fields. Due to differences in types of data, content, collection or
analysis methods there may be trends in data openness based on this
characterization. For example, physical data is collected by instruments and
can be downloaded automatically and undergoes pre-defined analysis protocols.
Scientists producing this sort of data may be more open to sharing since it
should take little additional work and external interpretation should be clear.
Alternatively, confidential or proprietary data, in the social sciences for
example, could cause those in such fields to sequester original data. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Similar to expected trends in
research field, agency affiliation may influence one’s willingness or ability
to share. If a scientist collects data under a public entity they may be more
compelled, or internally required, to make their data available to the public.
In contrast, private consulting firms may prefer to keep data in house in order
to protect clients or increase its profitability.&nbsp; Many public entities have internal data
sharing policies since they are publicly funded. Thus, these sectors, such as
government agencies, could have two requirements to publicly share data: their
home agency and an external funding requirement, and perhaps internal systems
of data sharing in place. Therefore, we would expect government groups to
provide data more often than private organizations. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>To test these trends, we focused
our study on the data-collection efforts of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee
Council (EVOSTC).&nbsp; The EVOSTC was formed following the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in the Gulf of Alaska in 1989, and has funded hundreds of projects since
its inception.&nbsp; The EVOSTC has required the publication of data within one
year of data collection for all recipients of their grants, but do not specify archiving
methods nor provide a specific publication platform. In 2010 the EVOSTC funded
the Gulf Watch Alaska group to create an open archive of all of the data
collected under their grants, previous and on-going. Within this group, the
National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was tasked with archiving
all of the <i>historic</i> data (1989-2010)
funded by the EVOSTC. These grants funded an array of government entities,
private consulting firms and non-governmental organizations, as well as a few Alaskan
native groups. The diversity of the grantees was also compounded by the variety
of scientific disciplines under which they operated.&nbsp; Within such a broad
field of data-collection, we wanted to know for how many of these projects we
could acquire data, if there were trends in data reporting based on data or
grantee characteristics and, if data were not procured, why we were
unsuccessful. The EVOSTC did make an effort to collect these data in the mid
1990s but the success of this effort is unknown as the content of this
collection has since been lost.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>
