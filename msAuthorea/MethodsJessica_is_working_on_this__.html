<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><div>Jessica is working on this section<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Recovery and publication:</b><br></div><div>From 2012 to 2014, a team of on full-time staff and three student interns was assigned to collect and archive data funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee
Council (EVOSTC) targeting those funded between 1989 and 2010.  Project information
was obtained from the projects page on the <a href="http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/index.cfm?FA=projects.search">EVOSTC website</a>
which includes varying levels of detail for each project, ranging from project
title only to full bibliographic information and attached reports. We tracked
the progress the data request and acquisition process for each project based on
six stages, which are outlined as follows: “emailed”, “replied”, “sent data”,
“data revised”, “published”, “unrecoverable”. Contact information was obtained
through agency sites and Google searches based on the information we were able
to gather from the EVOSTC site. If we were able to find contact information for
the listed principal investigator (either email or phone number), and outreach
email or phone call was made explaining the data recovery project and
requesting data for the project in question. Projects for which outreach could
be made were labeled “emailed”. If we then received a reply to the outreach and
could therefore confirm that the contact information was correct, the project
label was promoted to “replied”, regardless of level of cooperation expressed
in the response. Once we received data from for a project, the label was
changed to “data sent”. It was often difficult to determine how much data were
collected for each project so if any data were received, the project was deemed
successful. If the data were clean enough and/or the contact was responsive
enough to guide us through cleaning, formatting and metadata creation the data
were labeled “data formatted”. Once the contact approved our edits and compiled
metadata, the products were then published to the <a href="https://goa.nceas.ucsb.edu">Gulf of Alaska Historic Data
Portal</a> and the
project was labeled, “published”. <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Statistical Analysis:</b><br></div><div><div>Results of the outreach efforts are further
characterized based on three project descriptors: <i>research field of the project</i> (field), <i>agency sector of the home institution of the principal investigato</i>r
(sector), <i>age of data when data when
recovery efforts were initiated</i> (age). Age of data is calculated as the
number of years since the last year a project received EVOSTC funding since
some projects spanned multiple years. <br></div><br></div><div>The impacts of these characteristics on the
likelihood of providing data are assessed using simple binomial statistical
tests: Chi-squared and binomial linear regression (BLM). Chi-squared tests were
run on each group of characteristics individually to test for differences in
success of obtaining data within a group. A BLM was run on all of the data to
test which elements of the projects are most indicative of data reporting
across all groups. <br></div>
