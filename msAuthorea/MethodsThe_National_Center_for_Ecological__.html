<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><div>The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was tasked with archiving all of the historic (1989-2010) data funded by the EVOSTC. In order to assess our success, we asked: for
      how many EVOSTC funded projects can we recover data? Of these projects we were interested in trends in reporting, particularly, which grantees were more likely to provide data and if there was a temporal trend as predicted by Michener (1997). To test this we asked if there are differences in data reporting based on any of three project characteristics: data field, grantee's agency sector, age of data. Finally, we wanted to know, of the data we are unable to recover, why were data not shared? Throughout our extensive data recovery effort, we took  careful notes of our communications and efforts to publicly archive  acquired data then statistically analyzed&nbsp;the results.<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Data recovery and archiving:<br></h2><div>From 2012 to 2014, a team of one full-time staff member and
three part-time student interns was assigned to collect and archive data funded
by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC) targeting those projects
funded between 1989 and 2010. Project information was obtained from the
projects page on the <a href="http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/index.cfm?FA=projects.search">EVOSTC website</a> which includes varying levels
of detail for each project, ranging from project title only to full
bibliographic information and attached reports. We tracked the progress the
data request and acquisition process for each project based on six stages,
which are outlined as follows: “emailed”, “replied”, “sent data”, “data revised”,
“published”, “unrecoverable”. Contact information was obtained through agency
sites and Google searches based on the information we were able to gather from
the EVOSTC site. If we were able to find contact information for the listed
principal investigator (either email address or phone number), an outreach
email or phone call was made explaining the data recovery project and
requesting data for the project in question. Projects for which outreach could
be made were labeled “emailed”. If we then received a reply to the outreach and
could therefore confirm that the contact information was correct, the project
label was promoted to “replied”, regardless of level of cooperation expressed
in the response. Once we received data from for a project, the label was
changed to “data sent”. Since it was often difficult to determine how much data
were collected for each project, if any data were received the project was considered
successful. If the data were clean and well documented enough and/or the
contact was responsive enough to guide us through any necessary data edits and
metadata creation the data were labeled “data formatted”. Once the contact
approved our edits and compiled metadata, the products were then published to
the <a href="https://goa.nceas.ucsb.edu">Gulf of
Alaska Historic Data Portal</a> and the project was labeled,
“published”. <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical Analysis:<br></h2><div>At the close of the data collation effort, we quantified the
number of projects that fell into each of the above status labels and plotted them
in a simple bar chart in order to assess the final status of our archiving undertaking.
<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Results of the outreach efforts are further characterized
based on three project descriptors: <i>research field of the project</i>
(field), <i>agency sector of the home institution of the principal investigato</i>r
(sector), <i>age of data when data when recovery efforts were initiated</i>
(age). Age of data is calculated as the number of years since the last year a
project received EVOSTC funding since some projects spanned multiple years. <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>The impacts of these characteristics on the likelihood of
providing data are assessed using simple binomial statistical tests:
Chi-squared and random forest analyses. Chi-squared tests were run on each
group of characteristics individually to test for differences in success based
on these classifications. We then asked which of these characteristics were the
most important in determining if the data from a project will successfully be
recovered. Do assess the relative importance of the three characteristics we
ran a random forest analysis using the “party” package in the R programming
language. We also produced one classification tree to visualize how these
characteristics affect our outcome. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Hurdles to recovery: <br></h2><div>Also of interest are
the reasons data were not recovered. To quantify these responses we categorized
the projects for which we were unable to gather any data based on notes from
our correspondences.&nbsp; The projects
included in this analysis include those labeled “emailed”, “replied” and
“unrecoverable” in the status categorization. Projects in the category
“replied” where instances where we received at least an initial reply confirming
that we had accurate contact information but lost communication before the data
was sent. These projects have been re-categorized here as <i>communication lost</i>. Of the “unrecoverable” projects, notes were
used to divide these into: <i>no contact
information</i>, <i>data lost</i>, <i>non-digital data</i>, <i>unwilling to share</i>, and <i>requested
additional funding</i>. The projects from the “emailed” status have been added
to the <i>no contact information</i> group
since we were never able to confirm the outreach efforts actually reached the
target recipient. Data are only labeled <i>data
lost</i> if our contact confirmed that they were so. Similarly, the <i>non-digital data</i>, <i>unwilling to share</i> and <i>requested
additional funding&nbsp;</i>cases are only labeled as such for projects were data
requests were rejected for these confirmed reasons. Non-digital data is deemed
“unrecoverable” here since our project lacked the resources to convert or store
such data. We have since converted these data, when possible, and refer to
these data in the discussion. <br></div><div><br></div>
