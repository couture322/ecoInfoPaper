physical oceanography projects, 38% of oil projects, 10% of social 
science projects, and 0% of modeling projects, these research fields had
 less than 30 projects each (Figure 2).&nbsp; 
Biological  projects were the most numerous (235), yet we only recovered
 data from 24% of those projects (Figure 2).&nbsp; To understand this 
pattern, we divided the 
biological field further and found the highest recovery rate (45%) 
for invertebrate-focused projects, and  the lowest recovery for 
habitat-focused (19%) and 
fisheries projects (20%) despite fisheries studies being the most 
numerous (n = 94).&nbsp; </i><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (4%, n = 10) 
and not one of the main factors in our failure to recover data  (Figure 
3).&nbsp; Loss of communication was the largest hurdle to recovering data.&nbsp; 
The majority of projects for which data were not recovered became 
stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators 
(PIs) had been made, but contact was ultimately lost before any data 
were recovered (50%, n = 116) (Figure 5).&nbsp; While this could have been 
because PIs had reasons they wouldn't share the data (see Disucssion), 
PIs requested funding for recovering only 1% (n = 3) of projects and 
flatly refused to share data from only 2% (n = 4) of projects.&nbsp; The 
second most common hurdle to data recovery was a lack of contact 
information for PIs or data managers, including projects entirely 
lacking contact info, as well as those with phone numbers or e-mail 
addresses from which we never received a reply (35%, n = 82)  (Figure 
3).&nbsp; Data was entirely lost from 7% (n = 17) of the projects due to 
deceased PIs, obsolete technology, and discarded files.&nbsp; Overall, the 
biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with 
the data producers or PIs at all stages of the recovery process</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><i><b>Discussion outline:</b></i><br></div><div><i><b>first re-state results without going into major detail again:</b></i><br></div><div><b>we recovered 26% of data</b><br></div><div><b>temporal: nope.</b><br></div><div><b>sectors: no diferences between agency type</b><br></div><div><b>there were differences between research fields (more data recovered from physical oceanography)</b><br></div><div>Overall we documented a low rate of data recovery: data were successfully recovered from 26% of all funded projects. Because we considered success to be the receipt of any (but potentially not all) data associated with a funded project (which often comprised multiple datasets), our estimate of 26% is conservative and likely masks a much lower recovery rate at the dataset level. In contrast to our expectations, we did not find a greater recovery rate among more recent projects, although we did observe a statistically insignificant increase in the fraction of projects for which data recovery was successful in the two most recent years of study (<i>is this correct?</i>). Recovery rate did not vary with agency type, but did vary with research field, with physical oceanography data having a much greater recovery success rate (58%) than other fields.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><li><div><i><b>although there have been Reporting requirements in place for a while, recovery rate hasn't changed and people still don't share ...</b></i><br></div></li><ul><li><div><i><b>Publishers</b></i><br></div></li><li><div><i><b>Funders</b></i><br></div></li><li><div><b><i>...But still not happening<br><br></i></b><br></div></li></ul><div><i>I think we can roll the next 3 points (I'm numbering them </i><b><i>1-3 </i></b><i>below for clarity when we talk about this, not for the ms) into a single 'first' sentence, then branch out from there (these could probably all be a single paragraph, or more if anyone wants to expand):</i><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>We document a low data recovery rate
similar to that from a study over 50 years ago (Wollins 1962), despite the advent
of several factors in the intervening time period which should have promoted and facilitated data sharing. &nbsp;We also report a similar rate to more recent reports of data recovery attempts (Wichert et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009; Fig.
X). <b>* </b>Although we did not perform an exhaustive literature search or meta-analysis of other similar historical studies, we note the  similarity in data recovery rates among our study and those cited above (1962, 2006, 2009).<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><b>(1) </b>The requirement to share data did not appear to increase data recovery rates. Although data reporting requirements from funding agencies and publishers have been in place for _____ 
(how long? e.g. several decades?), our documented recovery rate was 
similar to that reported by Wollins (xx %; 1962) over 50 years ago, 
prior to the advent of  data sharing / reporting requirements. We 
also noted a 
similar success rate to that reported in 2006 (Wichert et al. 2006) and 2009 (Savage &amp; Vickers 2009), both of which requested data associated with publications whose journals required data sharing on 
request. We note that, relative to these 3 studies, we  invested considerably more effort in data recovery (with respect to person
hours, number of projects we ‘chased’, number of contact attempts, and an
electronic tracking system (ie the Redmine issues)), without noticeable
difference in recovery success.<br></div><ul><li><div><i><b>Open science movement:</b></i><br></div></li><ul><li><div><i><b>Data sharing is important … but there are challenges</b></i><br></div></li></ul><div><div><i>Not sure what we wanted to put here? </i><br></div><div><b>(2) </b>The advent of a culture of data sharing also had no apparent effect on recovery success relative to historical success rates.<br></div><div><br></div><br></div></ul><li><div><i><b>Historical assessments of data sharing </b></i><br></div></li><ul><li><div><div><div><b><i>altough we didn't do a metaanalysis, recovery rates are similar to 50 yrs ago (note I've put this at * above)<br></i></b><br></div><div><i>I think this can be folded into "although there have been Reporting requirements in place

So I'm adding that here:</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>(3) </b>The advent of technological advances  also appeared to have no impact on data recovery rates relative to historical success rates. Technological advances in data capture, storage (including large volume storage), accessibility,
and ease of duplication and transfer (including electronic data formats and email
availability) should have facilitated data recovery, but did not. This is supported by our observation that (i) the frequency of non-digital project data was low (4%, n = 10), 
and (ii) that non-recovery attributable to the 'other' category (deceased PIs, obsolete technology, and discarded files) was also low (7% of projects, n = 17).&nbsp;<br></div><div>Our results, combined with the similar recovery rate to the older papers, suggest that the availability of suitable digital
technology was never and is not now a factor in data recovery success. Non-recovery
attributable to factors which could have been circumvented by technological
advances – i.e. data loss (including loss of records, inability to read some hardware
or data formats like floppy disks and rare file types) and non-digital formats
(eg paper records) – accounted for only XX% (low %) of data not recovered. Notably,
X% of this data loss was attributable to loss of data by the funding body (the
infamous CD).&nbsp; Furthermore, we saw no
difference in recovery rate between projects conducted before and after 2000
(**or some other way of marking the digital age?**) – there was a similar
success rate for all projects conducted &gt;5 years prior to our data request.
Additionally, there was no difference in data recovery rate between Wollins’
study published 1962 (when recent tech was not available) and the group of
recent studies (Wichert et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009, and the present
study; all conducted in the age of tech advances). Collectively these results suggest
that lack of digital technology was not a factor in data recovery success.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div></li></ul><div>One of our main questions was why didn't people share their data. There was no significant differences between research sectors, but is this likely because we lacked the statistical power to detect significant differences <i>(E.g. were the stats tests not significant because the equation for the test statistic is unable to find a significant difference between a category with many members (eg 120 in government) vs a category with very few members, eg 3 in tribes)? - Jessica - can you expand on this just a bit to fill in the stats?) </i>However<i>, </i>we noted statistically significant variation in data recovery between research topics, suggesting that the research topics of oil, physical oceanography,  plankton, and invertebrates were more likely to share their data than the topics of fisheries, birds, mammals, habitat, modeling, and social studies. We expand on potential reasons why below. In general, differences in recovery rates by study category may be attributable, in part, to the time required to prepare data for sharing as well as whether or not certain data types could be misused or misinterpreted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are a number of reasons specific to the topics of&nbsp;oil, physical oceanography, plankton, and invertebrates which may explain why researchers in these fields are likely to share their data. Many of the oil data sets for this data salvaging project were collected by a single agency (<i>Jessica - what was this agency?</i>), so it was straightforward to obtain many data sets once communication with that agency was opened. Meanwhile, both physical oceanography and plankton data sets are often collected using systematic and automated approaches. Once data are collected, they often do not require manual data entry but are already in a final format that is ready to be shared. Previous research indicates data sharing increases with the level of data collection  automation&nbsp;[Pritchard et al. 2004]. We postulate that researchers may also be likely to share inveterate data because these are collected using direct observation (i.e., percent cover), and again are ready to share immediately without post-processing or fear of misinterpretation.<br></div><div><br>There are several reasons why researchers in fields relating to fisheries, birds, mammals, and social studies may not share their data.&nbsp;While data sharing and data recovery between scientists, stakeholders, and institutions is a challenge for many fields, the field of fisheries poses unique challenges that may also require unique solutions to overcome. Fisheries data are often sensitive in nature. They may be used for assessing vulnerable stocks that are fished by diverse groups, setting management controls such as total allowable catch limits, or monitoring the catch of sensitive or protected species. This can understandably raise concern with stakeholders who may worry that sharing their data could reveal prized fishing grounds, result in more restrictive or inequitable management, reveal illegal fishing patterns, or even lead to a fishery or particular areas being closed [Froese et al 2004; Mackinson et al 2011]. To overcome these concerns, a shared culture and strategy of collaborative research and data management should be developed between scientists, fishers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders from the onset of any new fisheries data collection program. Through this approach, shared expectations and objectives can be set such that all stakeholders understand how data will be used and how this may impact management decisions [CEC 2009; Johnson et al. 2007; Wiber et al. 2009].<br></div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, bird and mammal data sharing faces its own unique challenges. Bird data is often collected using citizen science, where the observers have varying levels of training and identification expertise [Borgman 2012]. Researchers may therefore be hesitant to share these data with a broader audience over fears of misinterpretation or misuse. Bird data also often includes estimates of population abundance. However, estimating population abundance could be obtained from direct or indirect observation, each of which come with certain assumptions and sampling techniques, making their integration into larger analyses non-trivial; researchers may again be concerned their studies could be misused [Baker and Millerand 2010]. Specifically for seabirds, their associated data is often complex with focuses on sitings, nesting success, and colony size. However, there is currently no recognized standard for how these data should be structured [Huettmann 2011]. Meanwhile, researchers studying marine mammals often work with small populations with limited geographic coverage, such as dolphins that may not travel widely. These researchers may be more protective over their research population since they have spent so much time and effort trying to understand it [Meyer 2009]. Additionally, for marine mammal photo ID projects, there is no common naming, format, or filing standard [Baker and Millerand 2010].<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, recovery of social science data also shares many of the same challenges as those faced with other data types, but comes with its own unique reasons why data sharing may be more limited. In particular, there may be concerns with certain types of social science data sets in which individual human subjects could be identified, which poses the risk of privacy and confidentiality violations if data are mishandled. These concerns could be mitigated, however, by protection of human subject anonymity through the deletion of identifiers,&nbsp;aggregation of data away from individuals, and privacy-enhanced data sharing protocols and intellectual property rules [Fienberg et al. 1985, Sieber 1991, King 2011].<br><br></div><div><b>References for discussion (this covers </b><br></div><ul><li><a href="http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721">http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375</a><br></li><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF</a><br></li><li><a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short">http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ijUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=sharing+research+data+fienberg&amp;ots=bG0vHnkNzp&amp;sig=MVHLCiJJ-1BQeZ8G_TaGcvNAY70#v=onepage&amp;q=sharing%20research%20data%20fienberg&amp;f=false</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-O1yAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22data+sharing%22+%22social+science%22&amp;ots=qSuv7t8XxK&amp;sig=WvQQt48cEB1R4xSbmGlecos2aG4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22data%20sharing%22%20%22social%20science%22&amp;f=false</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/719.full</a><br></li><li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22634/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22634/full</a><br></li><li><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.473&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.473&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a><br></li><li><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.473&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://bentham-open.com/contents/pdf/TOOENIJ/TOOENIJ-4-1.pdf</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/UCSB_US/S040823P.pdf">http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/UCSB_US/S040823P.pdf</a><br></li></ul><div><div><br></div><div>- lack of institutional infrastructure (i.e. lack of dedicated
money and, by extension, personnel) to handle data sharing (ADFG) ... this arises from the 'time / too much work' point above<br></div><br><div>- some people only shared when they were seeking continuation of
funding (GWA; find a diplomatic way to say this)<br></div><br></div><div><div>Non-recovery of data was most commonly attributable to loss of contact with data holders and lack
of contact information, suggesting that a lack of 
planning for long-term data archiving (on the part of data PIs, funding agencies, and journals) was the most important barrier to 
data sharing ... <i><b>Jessica, were these reasons uniformally distributed across agency type and reserarch sector? If so, then we can say this was a universal pattern.</b></i> This lack of planning encompasses the lack of foresight to handle attrition of personnel (movement of personnel between institutions, retirement, death) and may also reflect a lack of proper data curation right from the start, 
meaning that it's difficult and takes a lot of time for data PIs to go back and reconstruct data
 packages suitable for use by others unfamiliar with the original work. Additionally, several PIs 
requested funding to cover their time to format data for sharing, further suggesting that data had not been properly curated from the start. Wichert et al. (2006)
 and Savage &amp; Vickers (2009) also reported that this ("too 
much work") was an important reason underlying unsuccessful data recovery.&nbsp; <i>solution: data repositories are important.</i><br></div><br></div><div><div>In broader terms, the most commonly reported reasons for not sharing data,
both in our study and in the literature, point to a lack of reward structure
and high perceived risk for sharing data. Most importantly, there exists little to no reward structure for sharing data.&nbsp;Even if required by
 the original funding agency, there is no reward for this care (including learning how to curate data) and time 
investment (it takes time away from current work and doesn't get the PI 
any new grants ... caveat: unless they're applying for funding from the 
same agency). This issue is exacerbated if data are not curated properly from the start.&nbsp; <i>Now go into high perceived risk ...</i><br></div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Perceived risks / disincentives: <br></div><div>(i) concern about others finding errors in their results &amp; conclusions (see

 Michener et al. 1997 ... although we did not observe a gradual decrease
 in data recovery over time, we did observe a greater success rate in 
the most recent years, which generally agrees with their overall result 
that data recovery rates decrease with time since data collection. (that
 we didn't see the gradual decline may be an artifact of evaluating 
projects instead of datasets).<br></div><div><i>WERE THERE TEMPORAL TRENDS IN REASONS FOR NON-RECOVERY? EG
