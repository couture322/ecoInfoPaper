section will need revision (or at least rearrangement) depending on how the
Introduction is structured.&nbsp; I’ll clean this up into proper sentences /
grammar and make it read better at that time!*</b><br></div><div>* In the Intro or Discussion, we should quote the text from
EVOSTC grant decisions requiring data sharing.<br></div><div>* An idea we could build on, from Wicherts et al. 2006: In
the public discourse of science, there should be a shift from [authors’
interpretation of data] to [the data themselves].<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Discussion text (CW):<br></div><div>We document a low data recovery rate
similar to that reported over 50 years ago (Wollins 1962), despite the advent
of several factors which should promote and facilitate data sharing. &nbsp;We also report a similar rate to those
reported in 2006 and 2009 (Wichert et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009; Fig.
X).&nbsp; Factors which should promote and
facilitate data sharing: technological advances in data capture, storage, accessibility,
and ease of duplication (the latter including electronic format and email
availability), a shift towards a culture of data-sharing, and requirements by
journal and funding bodies for data sharing. Compared to these 3 studies in
Table X, we also invested considerably more effort in data recovery (re person
hours, number of projects we ‘chased’, number of contact attempts, and an
electronic tracking system (ie the Redmine issues)), without noticeable
difference in recovery success.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Our results suggest that the <b><u>availability</u></b> of suitable digital
technology was never and is not now a factor in data recovery success. Non-recovery
attributable to factors which could have been circumvented by technological
advances – i.e. data loss (including loss of records, inability to read some hardware
or data formats like floppy disks and rare file types) and non-digital formats
(eg paper records) – accounted for only XX% (low %) of data not recovered. Notably,
X% of this data loss was attributable to loss of data by the funding body (the
infamous CD).&nbsp; Furthermore, we saw no
difference in recovery rate between projects conducted before and after 2000
(**or some other way of marking the digital age?**) – there was a similar
success rate for all projects conducted &gt;5 years prior to our data request.
Additionally, there was no difference in data recovery rate between Wollins’
study published 1962 (when recent tech was not available) and the group of
recent studies (Wichert et al. 2006, Savage &amp; Vickers 2009, and the present
study; all conducted in the age of tech advances). Collectively these results suggest
that lack of digital technology was not a factor in data recovery success.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Instead,
we observed a threshold effect of time in recovery success – requests for data
collected &gt; 5 years prior to our request were markedly less successful (mean
~30% although there is a lot of variation) than requests for more recent data (mean ~ 65%? Fig. X; cite ANOVA or other stats test to say there was no effect of number of projects on success rate) <i>*although we
must decide whether to attribute this to time per se or rather personal
connections with Gulf Watch folks*</i>. This temporal threshold, combined with the
fact that the most frequent reasons for non-recovery was loss of contact with data holders and lack
of contact information suggest that ... <br></div><div>- a lack of planning for long-term data archiving was the most important barrier to data sharing (ie lack of foresight to handle attrition of personnel: retirement, death, movement of personnel between institutions)<br></div><div>- probably also lack of proper data curation right from the start, meaning that it's difficult for data PIs to go back and reconstruct data packages suitable for use by others ... several people we contacted wanted money to cover their time to do this, and the Wichert et al. 2006 and Savage &amp; Vickers 2009 studies also reported that this ("too much work") was an important reason in their studies. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>Cite Michener et al. 1997 ... although we did not observe a gradual decrease in data recovery over time, we did observe a greater success rate in the most recent years, which generally agrees with their overall result that data recovery rates decrease with time since data collection. (that we didn't see the gradual decline may be an artifact of evaluating projects instead of datasets).<br></div><div><i>WERE THERE TEMPORAL TRENDS IN REASONS FOR NON-RECOVERY? EG
MORE NON-RECOVERY IN EARLIER YEARS DUE TO DATA LOSS AND NON-DIGITAL FORMATS?</i><br></div><div>... Nevertheless, this reflects an issue with long-term data
archiving permanence, and the need for foresight in data archiving.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Requirement to share data did not appear to increase data recovery rates: Wolins 1962 (when data sharing was not required) reported a similar success rate to the 2006 &amp; 2009 studies
(which requested data published by journals requiring data sharing on request),
and our study (where the funder required data sharing).<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Why don’t people share?
Perhaps spin this as barriers to data sharing?<br></div><div>The most commonly reported reasons for not sharing data,
both in our study and in the literature, point to a lack of reward structure
and high perceived risk for sharing data; underlying problems are in bold text:<br></div><div>- most important = <b>no reward
structure for data sharing</b>!!!<br></div><div>- time required to compile
data (noted as important reasons by 2/3 of our literature comparison studies): it takes a lot of time to go back and recreate a data package suitable for use by others unfamiliar with the work. Even if required by the original funding agency, there is no reward for this time investment (it takes time away from current work and doesn't get the PI any new grants ... caveat: unless they're applying for funding from the same agency). underlying problems for this point: lack of reward structure, <b>lack of proper data curation right from the start</b><br></div><div>- also very common: loss of author contact information (eg retirement). underlying problem = <b>lack of&nbsp;foresight by
institutions, funding agencies, or journals for long-term data archiving</b>.
solution: data repositories are important.<br></div><div>Specific cases in our study:<br></div><div>- lack of institutional infrastructure (i.e. lack of dedicated
money and, by extension, personnel) to handle data sharing (ADFG) ... this arises from the 'time / too much work' point above<br></div><div>- some people only shared when they were seeking continuation of
funding (GWA; find a diplomatic way to say this)<br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>- Perceived risks / disincentives: <br></div><div>(i) concern about others finding errors in their results &amp; conclusions (see
speculation by all 3 other published studies), <br></div><div>(ii) retaining data ownership / authorship rights. We could cite the 2015-2016 series

<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In the discussion sections about discipline and agency categories, we can speculate about how some of the above reasons for not sharing data may underlie category differences:<br></div><div><br></div><div>Paragraph about results by study
category. <br></div><div><i>There was no sig diff between fields, but is this because
we lacked the statistical power to detect significant differences? &nbsp;E.g. were the stats tests not significant
because the equation for the test statistic is unable to find a significant
difference between a category with many members (eg 120 in government) vs a
category with very few members (eg 3 in tribes)? Same situation for physical vs
biological categories. Perhaps the new stats tests will resolve this? I’ll hold off on writing more about study and
agency categories until we know.</i><br></div><div>Differences in recovery rates by study category may be attributable, in part, to the time required to
prep a data package to share (<i>note that the "too much work" reason for not sharing was also noted by some of our comparison studies</i>): reflected in greater success rate in perhaps
chemical (oil) and especially
physical data? Physical data often consists of automatic measurements requiring
little / no lab or digital processing (data entry) (eg temperature, salinity),
and because we measure success as some data received from a project instead of
on a dataset-by-dataset basis, this bumps up the success rate for such
projects. Conversely, categories requiring considerable processing and data
entry (e.g. social studies, which may involve transcribing human interviews,
etc) seemed to have lower data recovery rates.<br></div><div><i><b>* Insert Gavin's fisheries section here*</b></i><br></div><div><i>On why fisheries data recovery can be a challenge (GM):</i><br></div><div>While data sharing and data recovery between scientists, stakeholders, and institutions is a challenge for many fields, the field of fisheries poses unique challenges that may also require unique solutions to overcome. Fisheries data are often sensitive in nature. They may be used for assessing vulnerable stocks that are fished by diverse groups, setting management controls such as total allowable catch limits, or monitoring the catch of sensitive or protected species. This can understandably raise concern with stakeholders who may worry that sharing their data could reveal prized fishing grounds, result in more restrictive or inequitable management, reveal illegal fishing patterns, or even lead to a fishery or particular areas being closed [Froese et al 2004; Mackinson et al 2011]. To overcome these concerns, a shared culture and strategy of collaborative research and data management should be developed between scientists, fishers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders from the onset of any new fisheries data collection program. Through this approach, shared expectations and objectives can be set such that all stakeholders understand how data will be used and how this may impact management decisions [CEC 2009; Johnson et al. 2007; Wiber et al. 2009].<br></div><ul><li><a href="http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721">http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375</a><br></li><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF</a><br></li><li><a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short">http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973</a><br></li></ul><div>Recovery of social science data shares many of the same challenges as those faced with other data types, but comes with its own unique reasons why data sharing may be more limited. In particular, there may be concerns with certain types of social science data sets in which individual human subjects could be identified, which poses the risk of privacy and confidentiality violations if data are mishandled. These concerns could be mitigated, however, by protection of human subject anonymity through the deletion of identifiers,&nbsp;aggregation of data away from individuals, and privacy-enhanced data sharing protocols and intellectual property rules [Fienberg et al. 1985, Sieber 1991, King 2011].<br></div><ul><li><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ijUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=sharing+research+data+fienberg&amp;ots=bG0vHnkNzp&amp;sig=MVHLCiJJ-1BQeZ8G_TaGcvNAY70#v=onepage&amp;q=sharing%20research%20data%20fienberg&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ijUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=sharing+research+data+fienberg&amp;ots=bG0vHnkNzp&amp;sig=MVHLCiJJ-1BQeZ8G_TaGcvNAY70#v=onepage&amp;q=sharing%20research%20data%20fienberg&amp;f=false</a><br></li><li><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-O1yAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22data+sharing%22+%22social+science%22&amp;ots=qSuv7t8XxK&amp;sig=WvQQt48cEB1R4xSbmGlecos2aG4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22data%20sharing%22%20%22social%20science%22&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-O1yAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22data+sharing%22+%22social+science%22&amp;ots=qSuv7t8XxK&amp;sig=WvQQt48cEB1R4xSbmGlecos2aG4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22data%20sharing%22%20%22social%20science%22&amp;f=false</a><br></li><li><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/719.full">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/719.full</a><br></li></ul><div>Additional discussion fodder on data sharing challenges by category:<br></div><div><b><ul><li><div>Yes:<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Oil: hot topic and collected by one agency, potentially legally mandated <br></div></li><li><div>Physical: comes out of a computer, systematic, etc<br></div></li><li><div>Bio: plankton: treated like oceanography data<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Data sharing increases with level of data collection/analysis automation (could be applicable to both bio and physical) [Pritchard et al. 2004]<br></div></li><ul><li><div><a href="http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/UCSB_US/S040823P.pdf">http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/UCSB_US/S040823P.pdf</a><br></div></li></ul></ul><li><div>Bio: inverts: Data are ready to share once they are collected (ie. % cover)<br></div></li></ul><li><div>No:<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Fish: privacy concerns, commercial interests, data misuse<br></div></li><ul><li><div>See above writeup<br></div></li></ul><li><div>Birds: Data misuse, difficult to estimate populations from surveys<br></div></li><ul><li><div>Bird data is often collected using citizen science, where the observers have varying levels of training and identification expertise [Borgman 2012].<br></div></li><ul><li><div><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22634/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22634/full</a><br></div></li></ul><li><div>Estimating population abundance could be obtained from direct or indirect observation, each of which come with certain assumptions and sampling techniques, making their integration non-trivial;
