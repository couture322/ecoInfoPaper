Fisheries data are often sensitive in nature. They may be used for assessing vulnerable stocks that are fished by diverse groups, setting management controls such as total allowable catch limits, or monitoring the catch of sensitive or protected species. This can understandably raise concern with stakeholders who may worry that sharing their data could reveal prized fishing grounds, result in more restrictive or inequitable management, reveal illegal fishing patterns, or even lead to a fishery or particular areas being closed [Froese et al 2004; Mackinson et al 2011]. To overcome these concerns, a shared culture of collaborative research and data sharing should be developed between scientists, fishers, and institutions from the onset of any new fisheries data collection program. Through this approach, shared expectations and objectives can be set such that all stakeholders understand how data will be used and how this may impact management decisions [CEC 2009; Johnson et al. 2007; Wiber et al. 2009].<br></div><ul><li><a href="http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721">http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?refid=209721</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001375</a><br></li><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF</a><br></li><li><a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short">http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/834.short</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X08000973</a><br></li></ul><div><br></div>
