<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Our data recovery and archiving efforts in context<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This effort to recover and archive data from research funded by the EVOS Trustee Council spanned ?? years, and involved a team of ???? people.&nbsp; We were able to publish data from ?? of 315 studies; our success rate was 26% (Figure 1).&nbsp; Our data recovery success was not significantly different (p = ????, Figure 1) than the successes reported by three previous studies  during the last 55 years that tried to recover data that were supposed to be publicly available (ex: federal and state government data, data required by journals or funders to be public). &nbsp; Thus, despite technological advances in data collection, entry, and storage in the last half century, we were no more successful in recovering data than previous attempts.&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data than historically, we examined the amount of effort (person hours) put into data recovery, the frequency of non-digital data, and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; Our data recovery took ??? person hours of effort, while previous studies had ???? hours (p = ????).&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (??? maybe 10 ???&nbsp; projects of 315) and not one of the main factors for our failing to recover data (Figure 2) (STATISTICAL TEST???).&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not published became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs), but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (???? out or 315) (Figure 3).&nbsp; These projects combined with those for which we received no reply led to a loss of communication being the most frequent reason we did not recover data (STATS???) (Figure 3).&nbsp; Finally, some PIs did send data from projects, however lack of metadata and supporting information for these data and a subsequent loss of contact with the PI still made this data unpublishable and unuseable by others. Therefore, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers at any stage of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">What factors increased our likelihood of recovering/archiving data ?<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover data from 26% of the projects, we wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data.&nbsp; We examined the effect of the time elapsed since the end of the project, and found that <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Temporal: Over time there have been about the same amount of data have been collected, except an uptick in recent years<br></div><ul><ul><li><div>Incentives to provide data bc still requesting funding from EVOSTC<br></div></li><li><div>The better we know someone the more likely we are to get the data (hence increase recently)?<br></div></li></ul></ul><div>Research Fields: <br></div><ul><li><div>Fish significant: is there a culture of not sharing<br></div></li><li><div>Are there other studies that saw these trends too?<br></div></li><li><div>Social significant: Data formats?<br></div></li></ul><div>Research Sectors: the more you own the data the more likely you are to report it...weird<br></div><ul><li><div><div>Public trust vs “privately” collected<br></div><div><br></div><br></div></li></ul><div><div><br></div><div><br></div>NOTE: Maybe add a quick figure of person hours or effort for the project comparison part. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: <br></div><div>Fig 1: successes of this and other studies <br></div><div>Fig 2: why we didn't recover data<br></div><div>Fig 3: Redmine category figure<br></div><div>Fig 4: Temporal figure - recovery success with years since project ended<br></div><div>Fig 5: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 6: Research Sectors<br></div><div><br></div>
