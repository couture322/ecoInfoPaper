<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Our data recovery and archiving success<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add more descriptive stuff here about number of datasets in each category, etc.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This effort to recover and archive data from research funded by the EVOS Trustee Council spanned ?? years, and involved a team of ???? people.&nbsp; We were able to publish data from ?? of 315 studies (Figure 1).&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover data from 26% of the projects, we 
wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data.&nbsp; We also examined whether the research field or sector influenced our
 recovery of project data.&nbsp; While we recovered data from approx. 60% of 
physical oceanography projects, 35% of chemical oceanography projects, 
15% of ecosystem/habitat projects, and 10% of social science projects 
(Figure 2), these research fields had no more than 36 projects each.&nbsp; 
Biological  projects were the most numerous (209), yet we only recovered
 data from 25% of those projects (Figure 2).&nbsp; We broke down the 
biological field even further and found the highest recovery rate (45%) 
for invertebrate-focused projects, and  the lowest recovery for 
fisheries projects (19%) despite fisheries studies being the most 
numerous (95).&nbsp; Research sectors generally did not affect our data 
recovery success significantly, but interesting patterns indicate that 
"privately" collected data may increase the change of data recovery 
compared to data in the public trust at governmental agencies (Figure 
3).&nbsp; We also examined the effect of the time elapsed since the end of the 
project, and found average recovery rates of  ???? 20% ???? and 70% ????
 for studies that ended &gt;5 five years and  &lt;5 years before 
recovery efforts respectively (Figure 4).&nbsp; However, other factors are 
likely influencing this seeming increase in recovery for recent projects
 (see Discussion).&nbsp; Overall, if projects were in the physical 
oceanography field and conducted by a federal government agency, we were
 more likely to recover data from these projects.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Hurdles to data recovery<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data, we examined the frequency of non-digital data, and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; Our data recovery took ??? person hours of effort, while previous studies had ???? hours (p = ????).&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (??? maybe 10 ???&nbsp; projects of 315) and not one of the main factors for our failing to recover data (Figure 2) (STATISTICAL TEST???).&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not published became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs), but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (???? out or 315) (Figure 5).&nbsp; These projects combined with those for which we received no reply led to a loss of communication being the most frequent reason we did not recover data (STATS???) (Figure 5).&nbsp; Finally, some PIs did send data from projects, however lack of metadata and supporting information for these data and a subsequent loss of contact with the PI still made this data unpublishable and unuseable by others. Therefore, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers at any stage of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><u><b>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: </b></u><br></div><div>Fig 1: Recovery Success<br></div><div>Fig 2: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 3: Research sectors<br></div><div>Fig 4: Temporal figure <br></div><div>Fig 5: Reasons for not sharing<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>NOTE: Maybe add a quick figure/table of person hours or effort for the project comparison part. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
