<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Our data recovery and archiving success<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This effort to recover and archive data from research funded by the EVOS
 Trustee Council spanned 4 years, and involved a team of 5 people.&nbsp; 
We were able to publish data from 60 of the 315 projects funded between 1989 - 2010 (Figure 1).&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover and publish data from 26% of the projects, we 
wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data, so we examined whether the research field or sector influenced our
 recovery of project data.&nbsp; While we recovered data from 58% of 
physical oceanography projects, 38% of oil projects, 10% of social science projects, and 0% of modeling projects, these research fields had less than 30 projects each (Figure 2).&nbsp; 
Biological  projects were the most numerous (235), yet we only recovered
 data from 24% of those projects (Figure 2).&nbsp; To understand this pattern, we divided the 
biological field further and found the highest recovery rate (45%) 
for invertebrate-focused projects, and  the lowest recovery for habitat-focused (19%) and 
fisheries projects (20%) despite fisheries studies being the most 
numerous (n = 94).&nbsp; Others included....(Figure 2).&nbsp; Research sectors generally did not affect our data 
recovery success significantly, but interesting patterns indicate that 
"privately" collected data may increase the change of data recovery 
compared to data in the public trust at governmental agencies (Figure 
3).&nbsp; We also examined the whether the recovery of data was correlated with the time elapsed since the end of the 
project, and found that recovery averaged ??? over the 23 year period, but overall there was no significant effect of time on recovery  (Figure 4).&nbsp; However, other factors may be influencing data recovery  (see Discussion).&nbsp; Overall, if projects were in the physical 
oceanography field and conducted by a federal government agency, we were
 more likely to recover the data regardless of how long ago a study was conducted.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Hurdles to data recovery<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data, we examined the frequency of non-digital data, and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (??? maybe 10 ???&nbsp; projects of 315) and not one of the main factors for our failing to recover data (Figure 5) (STATISTICAL TEST???).&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not published became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs), but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (???? out or 315) (Figure 5).&nbsp; These projects combined with those for which we received no reply led to a loss of communication being the most frequent reason we did not recover data (STATS???) (Figure 5).&nbsp; Finally, some PIs did send data from projects, however lack of metadata and supporting information for these data and a subsequent loss of contact with the PI still made this data unpublishable and unuseable by others. Therefore, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers at any stage of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><u><b>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: </b></u><br></div><div>Fig 1: Recovery Success<br></div><div>Fig 2: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 3: Research sectors<br></div><div>Fig 4: Temporal figure <br></div><div>Fig 5: Reasons for not sharing<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>NOTE: Maybe add a quick figure/table of person hours or effort for the project comparison part. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
