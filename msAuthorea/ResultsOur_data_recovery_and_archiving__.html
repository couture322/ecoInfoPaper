<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Our data recovery and archiving success<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This effort to recover and archive data from research funded by the EVOS
 Trustee Council spanned 2 years, and involved a team of 4 people.&nbsp; 
We were able to publish data from 60 of the 315 projects funded between 1989 - 2010 (Figure 1).&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover and publish data from 26% of the projects, we 
wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data, so we examined whether the research field or sector influenced our
 recovery of project data.&nbsp; While we recovered data from 58% of 
physical oceanography projects, 38% of oil projects, 10% of social science projects, and 0% of modeling projects, these research fields had less than 30 projects each (Figure 2).&nbsp; 
Biological  projects were the most numerous (235), yet we only recovered
 data from 24% of those projects (Figure 2).&nbsp; To understand this pattern, we divided the 
biological field further and found the highest recovery rate (45%) 
for invertebrate-focused projects, and  the lowest recovery for habitat-focused (19%) and 
fisheries projects (20%) despite fisheries studies being the most 
numerous (n = 94).&nbsp; Others included....(Figure 2).&nbsp; Research sectors generally did not affect our data 
recovery success significantly, but interesting patterns indicate that 
"privately" collected data may increase the change of data recovery 
compared to data in the public trust at governmental agencies (Figure 
3).&nbsp; We also examined the whether the recovery of data was correlated with the time elapsed since the end of the 
project, and found that recovery averaged ??? over the 23 year period, but overall there was no significant effect of time on recovery  (Figure 4).&nbsp; However, other factors may be influencing data recovery  (see Discussion).&nbsp; Overall, if projects were in the physical 
oceanography field and conducted by a federal government agency, we were
 more likely to recover the data regardless of how long ago a study was conducted.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Hurdles to data recovery<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data, we examined the frequency of non-digital data, and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (4%, n = 10) and not one of the main factors in our failure to recover data  (Figure 5).&nbsp; Loss of communication was the largest hurdle to recovering data.&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not recovered became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs) had been made, but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (50%, n = 116) (Figure 5).&nbsp; While this could have been because PIs had reasons they wouldn't share the data (see Disucssion), PIs requested funding for recovering only 1% (n = 3) of projects and flatly refused to share data from only 2% (n = 4) of projects.&nbsp; The second most common hurdle to data recovery was a lack of contact information for PIs or data managers, including projects entirely lacking contact info, as well as those with phone numbers or e-mail addresses from which we never received a reply (35%, n = 82)  (Figure 5).&nbsp; Data was entirely lost from 7% (n = 17) of the projects due to deceased PIs, obsolete technology, and discarded files.&nbsp; Overall, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers or PIs at all stages of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><u><b>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: </b></u><br></div><div>Fig 1: Recovery Success<br></div><div>Fig 2: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 3: Research sectors<br></div><div>Fig 4: Temporal figure <br></div><div>Fig 5: Reasons for not sharing<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>NOTE: Maybe add a quick figure/table of person hours or effort for the project comparison part. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
