<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Our data recovery and archiving efforts in context<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This effort to recover and archive data from research funded by the EVOS Trustee Council spanned ?? years, and involved a team of ???? people.&nbsp; We were able to publish data from ?? of 315 studies; our success rate was 26% (Figure 1).&nbsp; Our data recovery success was not significantly different (p = ????, Figure 1) than the successes reported by three previous studies  during the last 55 years that tried to recover data that were supposed to be publicly available (ex: federal and state government data, data required by journals or funders to be public). &nbsp; Thus, despite technological advances in data collection, entry, and storage in the last half century, we were no more successful in recovering data than previous attempts.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data than historically, we examined the amount of effort (person hours) put into data recovery, the frequency of non-digital data, and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; Our data recovery took ??? person hours of effort, while previous studies had ???? hours (p = ????).&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (??? maybe 10 ???&nbsp; projects of 315) and not one of the main factors for our failing to recover data (Figure 2) (STATISTICAL TEST???).&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not published became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs), but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (???? out or 315) (Figure 3).&nbsp; These projects combined with those for which we received no reply led to a loss of communication being the most frequent reason we did not recover data (STATS???) (Figure 3).&nbsp; Finally, some PIs did send data from projects, however lack of metadata and supporting information for these data and a subsequent loss of contact with the PI still made this data unpublishable and unuseable by others. Therefore, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers at any stage of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br></div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">What factors increased our likelihood of recovering/archiving data ?<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover data from 26% of the projects, we wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data.&nbsp; We examined the effect of the time elapsed since the end of the project, and found average recovery rates of  ???? 20% ???? and 70% ???? for studies that ended &gt;5 five years and  &lt;5 years before recovery efforts respectively (Figure 4).&nbsp; However, other factors are likely influencing this seeming increase in recovery for recent projects (see Discussion).&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also examined whether the research field or sector influenced our recovery of project data.&nbsp; While we recovered data from approx. 60% of physical oceanography projects, 35% of chemical oceanography projects, 15% of ecosystem/habitat projects, and 10% of social science projects (Figure 5), these research fields had no more than 36 projects each.&nbsp; Biological  projects were the most numerous (209), yet we only recovered data from 25% of those projects (Figure 5).&nbsp; We broke down the biological field even further and found the highest recovery rate (45%) for invertebrate-focused projects, and  the lowest recovery for fisheries projects (19%) despite fisheries studies being the most numerous (95).&nbsp; Research sectors generally did not affect our data recovery success significantly, but interesting patterns indicate that "privately" collected data may increase the change of data recovery compared to data in the public trust at governmental agencies (Figure 6). Overall, if projects were in the physical oceanography field and conducted by a federal government agency, we were more likely to recover data from these projects.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><u><b>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: </b></u><br></div><div><u><b></b></u>Fig 1: successes of this and other studies <br></div><div>Fig 2: why we didn't recover data<br></div><div>Fig 3: Redmine category figure<br></div><div>Fig 4: Temporal figure - recovery success with years since project ended<br></div><div>Fig 5: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 6: Research Sectors<br></div><div><br></div><div>NOTE: Maybe add a quick figure/table of person hours or effort for the project comparison part. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
