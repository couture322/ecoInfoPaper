 Trustee Council spanned 2 years, and involved a team of 4 people.&nbsp; 
We received data from 81, and were able to publish data from 60  of the 315 projects funded between 1989 - 2010 (Figure 1).&nbsp; Though we were only able to recover and publish data from 26% of the funded projects, we 
wanted to know what increased our likelihood of recovering data, so we examined whether the research field or sector influenced our
 recovery of project data.&nbsp; We found that research field significantly affected our recovery success (Chi-squared test, p = 0.0024), while research sector did not (Chi-squared test, p = 0.7604, Supp. Fig. A).&nbsp; In fact, research field was the most important predictor of recovery success (random forest, 0.0143), and research sector was not important (random forest, -0.0031).&nbsp; Most research fields had fewer than 30 projects each, but included both the highest and lowest recovery rates: we recovered data from 58% of 
physical oceanography projects, 38% of oil projects, 10% of social science projects, and 0% of modeling projects (Figure 2).&nbsp; However, biological  projects were the most numerous (235), yet we only recovered
 data from 24% of those projects.&nbsp; To better understand this data recovery pattern, we divided the 
biological field into sub-categories.&nbsp; We found that we recovered the most data from&nbsp;physical oceanography projects 
(58%), projects studying benthic invertebrates (45%),&nbsp;oil-sampling projects (38%), and projects studying plankton 
(33%) (classification tree, p = 0.007, Figure 3).&nbsp; We recovered far less data from projects studying mammals (27%), birds (24%), fish (20%), and habitats (19%), despite fisheries studies being the most numerous (n=94).&nbsp; Thus, data recovery does not appear related to the raw number of projects in a research field, but was influenced by the particular field of research undertaken.&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We also examined the whether the recovery of data was correlated with the time elapsed since the end of the 
project.&nbsp; We found that recovery averaged 27% over the 23 year period, but overall there was no significant effect of time on recovery (Chi-squared test, p = 0.0809)  (Supp Fig B).&nbsp; Recent (5 yrs or less) recovery rates seem highest (Supp Fig B), but other factors may be influencing data recovery patterns through time such as a low number of funded projects in recent years  (see Discussion).&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Hurdles to data recovery<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To examine why our efforts did not recover more data, we examined the frequency of non-digital data and where the process of recovering data got stuck.&nbsp; We found the frequency of non-digital project data to be quite low (4%, n = 10) and not one of the main factors in our failure to recover data  (Figure 4).&nbsp; Loss of communication was the largest hurdle to recovering data.&nbsp; The majority of projects for which data were not recovered became stalled after some initial contact with the Principal Investigators (PIs) had been made, but contact was ultimately lost before any data were recovered (50%, n = 116) (Figure 4).&nbsp; While this could have been because PIs had reasons they wouldn't share the data (see Disucssion), PIs requested funding for recovering only 1% (n = 3) of projects and flatly refused to share data from only 2% (n = 4) of projects.&nbsp; The second most common hurdle to data recovery was a lack of contact information for PIs or data managers, including projects entirely lacking contact info, as well as those with phone numbers or e-mail addresses from which we never received a reply (35%, n = 82)  (Figure 4).&nbsp; Data was entirely lost from 7% (n = 17) of the projects due to deceased PIs, obsolete technology, and discarded files.&nbsp; Overall, the biggest hurdle to recovering data remains a loss of communication with the data producers or PIs at all stages of the recovery process.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><u><b>Ordered List of Figures/Tables: </b></u><br></h2><div><div>Fig 1: Recovery Success<br></div><div>Fig 2: Research fields<br></div><div>Fig 3: Classification Tree<br></div><div>Fig 4: Reasons for not sharing<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Supplemental Figures: </u><br></div><div>Supp Fig A: Research sectors<br></div><div><div>Supp Fig B: Temporal figure <br></div><div>Supp Appendix A: Results of Binomial Regression for Temporal<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div>
