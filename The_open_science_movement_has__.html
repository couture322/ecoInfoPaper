<div>The open science
movement has developed new technologies and worked to move science forward with
a culture of data sharing but, as this study shows, there is still a lot of
work to be done. We found that while the reasons for <i>not</i> sharing were uniform across groups, a scientistâ€™s field of
research was the strongest indicator of whether they would collaborate to
archive required datasets in a public repository. To address this obstacle,
emerging tools should begin to target barriers specific to these fields with
proportionately lower representation. Some of these barriers might include
protecting proprietary information, difficulty in describing methods or
post-processing, and difficulty preparing data. Funders and publishers should
provide more support and more stringent requirements for data sharing.
Incorporating data support and tools into the funding or publication process
will help to increase data sharing. Finally, personal incentives such as DOI
citations for datasets should be more widely used to increase the impact of a
particular dataset as well as recognition and credit for data creation.
Although the integration of data publication into the scientific process has
been slow to be adopted, it is important to increasing efficiency and
transparency in science. The open science community should continue to impress
upon the science community in general, the benefits of open science and data
archiving, and develop a reward system for data sharing. <br></div>
